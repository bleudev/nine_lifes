Nine lifes - is a mod which gives you only 9 lifes for entire your survival. Cool challenge for those who are tired of the vanilla hardcore. For changes in lives count - use `/nl` command. Enjoy!)

For a better atmosphere:
- Install [CTR VCR shader](https://modrinth.com/shader/ctrvcr).
- Don't use resource packs which changes hearts because this mod changes them to hardcore ones.
